Hi! My name is Andrew Blinov, and im working with Angular, React, ES6, Node.js, vanillaJS(JQuery), worked a bit with Symfony(2, 3) and i want to show you all little projects what i've made. You could find in my rep tasks written on nativeJS, JQuery, Angular, CoffeeScript, React, Node.js and Meteor. So if you still here just grab all this things and start to test them =) Enjoy!
