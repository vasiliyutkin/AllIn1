                A South Bronx, New York native and powerful lyricist, Michael Bean Jr. is widely known in the entertainment industry as “Drake”. He attended Taft High School; one of New York’s roughest high schools in the city. As a teenager, Drake dealt drugs and led a dangerous street life as a way to earn a living. Drake embarked on his music career at the age of 19. He took full control of his life at the age of 25 and really started to push forward with his music career.
                As a major entertainer, Drake has since left those days behind that could have ended his career indefinitely. He has proven that never forgetting where he came from means honoring being the son of Michael Bean, Sr. and Sherry Bean but respecting the life of being raised in a single parent home with two siblings. As a family man and a dedicated father, he shares the responsibilities of raising his two children, a 10-year old son, Michael Keith Bean, III and a 3-year-old daughter, Mykel Andrea Bean.  Drake, wanting more out of life for himself and his children, understands the importance of setting his professional goals of becoming more focused on his career and building himself as a Brand.
