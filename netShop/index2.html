                        </h3>
                        <p>Our diamond earrings use 14K solid gold or .925 sterling silver to provide the best shine and quality possible. Our hip hop men's earrings, like our Diamond Collection, uses real diamonds cut into a round or princess style. Our male earrings all use hand-set stones placed along a micro pave or prong setting, while our casted silver studs use CZ stones with gold, black or rose-gold plated coatings. Although fashion in general can go through trends in a matter of months, men's earrings tend to remain in style for years. Today's men's diamond stud earrings for example, look practically identical to those from the 1980s when hip hop music became popular. For jewelry you plan to use for years to come, there's no better choice than diamond stud earrings for men.
