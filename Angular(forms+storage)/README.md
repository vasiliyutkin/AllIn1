Just start simple http server and check it out.
	in this project i used Restangular for REST(CRUD operations), services, modules, filters and decoupled them in many pieces. And....
		Just 1 controller, because i did this task as fast as could, pls sorry for that.
	And in this case i use PAPA john AngularJS styleguide for describing modules cntrollers etc.
		like --> angular.module('blabla', callback);
			function callback() {};
So enjoy!) And t.y. for you attention!
